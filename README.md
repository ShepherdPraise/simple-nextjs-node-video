## üöÄ Project Overview

The I-Recharge Application is a web-based platform designed to be highly available, scalable, and secure. It uses AWS services for cloud infrastructure and Docker for containerization. The project is automated with a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to build, test, and deploy the application to AWS.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The infrastructure is deployed using Terraform and includes the following AWS services:

- **Amazon EC2**: For running the application container.
- **Amazon RDS**: A PostgreSQL database instance.
- **Amazon ECR**: A private container registry for storing Docker images.
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: For securely managing database credentials.
- **AWS IAM**: For managing access permissions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Terraform
- AWS CLI
- Docker
- Node.js

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShepherdPraise/i-recharge.git
cd i-recharge
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure AWS CLI

Make sure your AWS CLI is configured with appropriate access credentials.

```bash
aws configure
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Build and Run the Application Locally

```bash
docker build -t i-recharge-app .
docker run -p 8080:8080 i-recharge-app
```

The app will be accessible at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## üì¶ Infrastructure Overview (Terraform)

The project uses Terraform to provision AWS resources. The infrastructure includes:

- EC2 Instance for running the app container.
- RDS (PostgreSQL) for the database.
- Secrets Manager for storing credentials.
- ECR for storing Docker images.

### üìÑ Terraform Commands

#### Initialize Terraform:

```bash
terraform init
```

#### Review the changes:

```bash
terraform plan
```

#### Apply the changes:

```bash
terraform apply
```

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

The project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The workflow automates:

- Building the Docker image
- Pushing the image to Amazon ECR
- Deploying the container to an AWS EC2 instance

### GitHub Actions Workflow File

```yaml
name: Build and Deploy to AWS

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up AWS Credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: us-east-1

      - name: Login to Amazon ECR
        id: ecr-login
        uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v1

      - name: Build Docker Image
        run: |
          docker build -t $ECR_REPO_NAME:latest .

      - name: Push to ECR
        run: |
          docker push ${{ env.AWS_ACCOUNT_ID }}.dkr.ecr.${{ env.AWS_REGION }}.amazonaws.com/$ECR_REPO_NAME:latest
```

## üîë Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required for the application:

| Variable              | Description                             |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `DB_HOST`             | The RDS instance endpoint               |
| `DB_PORT`             | The database port (5432)                |
| `DB_USERNAME`         | The database username                   |
| `DB_PASSWORD`         | The database password                   |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`   | AWS Access Key ID                       |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | AWS Secret Access Key                  |
| `ECR_REPO_NAME`       | Name of the Amazon ECR repo             |

## üíª Connecting to RDS Database

To connect to your RDS instance, use a tool like pgAdmin or DBeaver.  
Use the `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_USERNAME`, and `DB_PASSWORD` environment variables for the connection.
